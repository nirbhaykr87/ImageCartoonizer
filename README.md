# ImageCartoonizer
 This Flask app lets users upload images and convert them into cartoonized versions using edge detection and color quantization. The process involves reading the image, detecting edges, reducing colors with k-means clustering, and blending for a cartoon effect. Try it out by running the app and uploading an image!
